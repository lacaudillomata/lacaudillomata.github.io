I’m a seasoned computational scientist and community builder. I’m passionate about driving innovation and developing cutting-edge Geo AI and simulation technology while building collaborative, diverse, and inclusive communities.\nCurrently, at MDA Space, I lead AI/ML R\u0026amp;D projects and cross-functional teams to incubate novel Geointelligence solutions. I apply techniques in Gen AI, sensor fusion, deep learning, hidden Markov models, and geospatial data analysis for maritime and land monitoring applications.\nDuring my PhD and Industrial Mitacs Elevate Postdoc at the University of British Columbia, I worked with Eldad Haber’s and the Geophysical Inversion Facility research groups, which operate as Industry-Academia consortiums. These experiences exposed me to a wide variety of geophysical electromagnetic applications and provided me with a vibrant multidisciplinary environment to grow as an applied scientist. There I developed expertise in 3D electromagnetic geophysics forward and inverse modeling, particularly in multiscale and upscaling methods for natural resource exploration. In the last year of my postdoc, I explored the applicability of deep learning methods for aquifer resource prospectivity, which motivated me to continue as an industrial researcher in Geo AI.\nAs a community builder, I’ve led initiatives, events, and programs ranging from local to international scales. My efforts have focused on catalyzing the use of AI in Latin America, bridging scientific research with real-world applications, contributing to provide leadership and management skills for scientist, sharing knowledge and sparking innovative thinking for tech development, and promoting a more inclusive environment for female and Latin American computational and data scientists.\nMy education spanned top labs across Canada, Mexico, Spain, and the USA, including 7 research internships, at institutions like Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, the Polytechnic University of Valencia, the Complutense University of Madrid, the University of Texas at Dallas, the Mathematics Research Center, and Computational Geosciences, Inc.\nFeel free to explore my site to learn more about me and how I can help you.

One major reason for this is the fact that very fine meshes are often required to accurately discretize the physical properties of the media, which may vary over a wide range of spatial scales and several orders of magnitude. Using such fine meshes for the discrete models leads to solve large systems of equations that are often difficult to deal with.

Actualmente, algunos de los usos comerciales más dominantes de este tipo de métodos se encuentran en la exploración y el monitoreo de depósitos minerales, depósitos de agua y reservas de hidrocarburos.\nLos métodos EM infieren estructuras subterráneas a partir de mediciones de campos electromagnéticos. Las mediciones, o datos electromagnéticos, se adquieren a través de una gran variedad de sondeos geofísicos que típicamente se realizan en la tierra, en el mar o en pozos. Un componente importante en el procesamiento de dichos datos se realiza con técnicas de simulación electromagnética directa e indirecta, las cuales resultan en modelos detallados de propiedades físicas de interés de las estructuras subterráneas. Por ejemplo, si el objetivo del sondeo es detectar minerales, el resultado de dichas técnicas numéricas puede ser un modelo de la distribución de la conductividad eléctrica (propiedad física para caracterizar minerales) del subsuelo. La subsecuente interpretación geológica y la evaluación de estos modelos de conductividad permiten comprender la distribución espacial de las estructuras subterráneas y, en última instancia, conducen a tomar mejores decisiones durante el proceso exploración.\nLa simulación directa e indirecta de datos EM son poderosas herramientas de interpretación; sin embargo, al usarlas dentro de programas de exploración industrial resultan en problemas de costo computacional excesivo. Aunque el campo de la computación electromagnética ha avanzado bastante, la simulación directa e indirecta de datos EM para escenarios geofísicos realistas siguen siendo un gran desafío computacional, cuyo principal cuello de botella es la simulación directa de campos EM.\nLos escenarios geofísicos realistas a menudo consideran grandes dominios computacionales, así como geometrías con variación geológica, topográfica y otras características relacionadas con la simulación que varían en múltiples escalas espaciales (mm a km) y medios altamente heterogéneos. Estos dos factores influyen significativamente en el comportamiento de los campos EM resultantes y deben ser adecuadamente considerados durante el proceso de mallado para que la simulación nos de un resultado preciso. En particular, la malla usada en técnicas de discretización tradicionales, tales como elemento finito o volumen finito, se refina lo suficiente tal que capture la estructura de la heterogeneidad del modelo detalladamente. Esto conlleva al uso de mallas grandísimas y el problema se traduce a resolver sistemas de ecuaciones lineales grandísimos (del orden de millones o billones de ecuaciones).\nUna alternativa para simular eficientemente los campos electromagnéticos en estos casos es usar métodos multiscala. Estos métodos forman parte de la familia de métodos de reducción de dimensionalidad, los cuales aspiran a reducir el tamaño del sistema de ecuaciones lineales que será finalmente resuelto. Estos métodos han sido extensivamente estudiados y exitosos en la comunidad de dinámica de fluidos computacional para resolver el problema de simular eficientemente fluidos en medios porosos. En esta charla, se introducirán estos métodos, se discutirá como se puede expandir su aplicación al campo de la geofísica electromagnética, y se mostrarán resultados en un contexto minero.\n","date":1538611200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1538611200,"objectID":"ad5c1d29446c2fffe12a348e1eefed30","permalink":"https://lacaudillomata.com/talk/como-simular-eficientemente-campos-electromagneticos-en-aplicaciones-geofisicas/","publishdate":"2020-08-01T22:42:42-07:00","relpermalink":"/talk/como-simular-eficientemente-campos-electromagneticos-en-aplicaciones-geofisicas/","section":"event","summary":"Los métodos geofísicos electromagnéticos (EM) se han utilizado desde 1900 en aplicaciones industriales, geocientíficas y de ingeniería en todo el mundo para detectar, localizar y caracterizar recursos naturales en el subsuelo.","tags":["Keynote"],"title":"¿Cómo simular eficientemente campos electromagnéticos en aplicaciones geofísicas?","type":"event"},{"authors":["Wenke Wilhelms","Christoph Schwarzbach","Luz Angélica Caudillo Mata","Eldad Haber"],"categories":null,"content":" Publication use is subject to SEG terms of use and conditions.

This is especially useful for extensive geophysical models that include small-scale features. Applying the concept of multiscale methods, we avoid setting up a large and costly system of equations on the fine mesh where the material parameters are discretized on. Instead, we build and solve a system on a much coarser mesh. For doing that, it is inevitable to interpolate between fine and coarse meshes. The construction of this coarse-to-fine interpolation is done by solving local, frequency-independent optimization problems for the electric field and the magnetic flux on each coarse cell incorporating the fine-mesh features. Hence, the interpolation operators transfer the fine-mesh material properties onto the coarse simulation mesh. To increase the accuracy of the interpolation, we apply oversampling; i.e., the coarse-cell optimization problems are solved on extended local domains. Previous work on multiscale methods for Maxwell’s equations is not capable of keeping the mimetic properties of the discretization. With our method being mimetic, the properties of the continuous differential operators are preserved in their discrete counterparts and thus, the resulting simulations do not contain spurious modes. We determine the effectiveness of our multiscale construction with coarse-mesh simulations for two examples, a vertical borehole and a mine model.","tags":[],"title":"The mimetic multiscale method for Maxwell’s equations","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Luz Angelica Caudillo Mata","Eldad Haber","Christoph Schwarzbach"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1532476800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1532476800,"objectID":"6c999a084b12828da60aecef74751a49","permalink":"https://lacaudillomata.com/talk/multiscale-modeling-of-geophysical-electromagnetic-fields-in-highly-heterogeneous-media/","publishdate":"2020-08-01T22:35:27-07:00","relpermalink":"/talk/multiscale-modeling-of-geophysical-electromagnetic-fields-in-highly-heterogeneous-media/","section":"event","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"Multiscale Modeling of Geophysical Electromagnetic Fields in Highly Heterogeneous Media","type":"event"},{"authors":[],"categories":[],"content":"Roles:\nMember of the scientific organizing committee Facilitator and co-organizer of the panel: Intercambio, Mobilidad y Reincorporación.

However, in practice, these simulations are computationally expensive. The geophysical settings consider highly heterogeneous media and features at multiple spatial scales that require a very large mesh to be accurately represented. This results in a system of equations to be solved that often exceeds the limits of average computers. Thus, the key is to reduce the problem size but retain the accuracy of the electromagnetic responses. Upscaling and multiscale techniques have been successfully applied to the problem of simulating fluid flow through heterogeneous porous media, where they are able to drastically reduce the size of the resulting fine-mesh system by casting it into a coarse-mesh system that is much cheaper to solve, while achieving a level of accuracy similar to that obtained with conventional discretization schemes. Recognizing the success that such techniques have had in fluid flow applications, this dissertation extends their use for application to electromagnetic modeling. In this dissertation, two new parallel simulation methods for the quasi-static Maxwell’s equations in the frequency domain are proposed, an upscaling framework for the electrical conductivity, and a multiscale finite volume with oversampling method. Both methods are combined with an adaptive mesh refinement technique (OcTree) to boost their computational performance. The performance of these methods is demonstrated by using field-inspired and synthetic examples that include a large electrical conductivity contrast. This investigation shows that both proposed methods are feasible to tackle geophysical electromagnetic problems, where being able to reduce the size of the problem can be particularly advantageous when extended domains are considered or when the mesh must capture the spatial distribution of the media heterogeneity outside the region where the electromagnetic responses are measured. Furthermore, both methods are new contributions to the literature in the field of computational methods in geophysical electromagnetics. Finally, both methods increase the current predictive and analytic capabilities by making the simulation of electromagnetic responses in larger and more complex geophysical settings more feasible than currently is possible.","tags":[],"title":"Multiscale and upscaling methods for geophysical electromagnetic forward modeling","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"The focus of this investigation is to study how to reduce the computational cost of simulating the behavior of electromagnetic fields in complicated geophysical settings.

For example, in many physical systems, measurements are obtained on the exterior of an object (e.g., the human body or the earth’s crust), and they are used with the goal of estimating the internal structure(s) or physical properties of such object.\nCurrently, the main challenges in the field of inverse problems are (1) the affordable computation of the forward model, especially for models with multiple length-scale features, (2) the efficient and reliable computation of solutions to inverse problems, and (3) the development of statistical methods to validate model assumptions and inversion estimates. Sophisticated tools from statistics, numerical optimization, numerical linear algebra, and multiscale analysis are required to address these challenges.\nThe goal of this special session is to gather a diverse and accomplished pool of experts working in the active and thriving research area of computational inverse problems who will present an overview of the state of-the-art methods to address the key challenges discussed. For example, speakers will present on new nonlinear optimization approaches, novel regularization techniques, iterative reconstruction techniques (e.g., hybrid methods and preconditioners), methods for statistical validation and uncertainty quantification, and the progress on multiscale methods and their applications within an inversion procedure.\nConference Program ","date":1500940800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1500940800,"objectID":"41b6ce00a91c2d0ed1b22cbf7ce7cb1c","permalink":"https://lacaudillomata.com/community/2017-congress-americas/","publishdate":"2017-07-25T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/community/2017-congress-americas/","section":"community","summary":"This symposium, part of the Mathematical Congress of the Americas 2017, convenes experts in computational inverse problems to tackle key challenges: efficient forward and inverse modeling, and the development of statistical methods to validate model assumptions and inversion estimates.","tags":["Symposium"],"title":"MCA 2017: Computational Inverse Problems: from Multiscale Modeling to Uncertainty Quantification Symposium","type":"community"},{"authors":["Luz Angelica Caudillo Mata","Eldad Haber","Christoph Schwarzbach"],"categories":null,"content":"Accurate and efficient simulation of electromagnetic (EM) responses in large-scale settings with highly heterogeneous media and features varying at multiple spatial scales is crucial to the exploration and imaging of geological formations in a wide range of geophysical applications.

Los modelos geofísicos realistas consideran la compleja geología relevante del medio, la cual es altamente heterogénea, e incluyen partes con variación sobre varias escalas de longitud.

[1]\nIn recent years, electromagnetic modelling and inversion techniques based on finite volume and finite elements have been studied extensively due to their usefulness in theory as well as in practice [2]. Although the theoretical foundation for these methods is straight-forward, it can face major difficulties when used to simulate realistic situations.\nOne of the fundamental issues is modelling the vast heterogeneity of geological targets in terms of scale, magnitude and anisotropy. Robust and accurate simulations require very fine meshes, especially when the earth is highly heterogeneous. Such meshes are difficult-to-work-with and may lead to very expensive-to-compute simulations when considering large earth-multiscale scenarios. For instance, geological characterizations typically contain on the order of 1e7 to 1e8 cells. These models, which are referred as fine models, represent geological variations on very fine scales vertically, though their areal resolution is still relatively coarse [3].\nNumerical upscaling is a mathematical procedure that strive to develop coarse scale models to accurately approximate fine scale ones. Therefore, it is a useful resource to alleviate the computational cost. Upscaling of Maxwell’s equations presents big challenges such as choosing the appropriate upscaling method and the assessment of risk and uncertainty in geological characterizations.\nIn this work, we present insights on how to build an efficient framework that allows for homogenization and upscaling of the Maxwell’s Equations’ coefficients trying to address the challenges mentioned above. One example on geological characterization is provided.\nReferences [1] D. Oldenburg and D.
